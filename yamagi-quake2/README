To play Quake 2 with this port, you must copy the file 'pak0.pak' and
the folder 'video' from your Quake 2 distribution (CD, Steam) to
/usr/share/games/quake2/baseq2/

If you don't want the game assets to be available system wide, you can
copy the files to ~/.yq2/baseq2/ instead.

Make sure the filenames are all in lower case.
