To play Quake with this port, you must copy the files 'config.cfg',
'pak0.pak', and 'pak1.pak' to ~/.quakespasm/id1/

Make sure the filenames are all in lower case.

If you want music, copy the music in either mp3 or ogg/vorbis format to
~/.quakespasm/id1/music with the filenames track02.ogg through track11.ogg.
